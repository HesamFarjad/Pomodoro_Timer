Overview
This is a Pomodoro Timer application built using Python's Tkinter library. The Pomodoro Technique is a time management method developed by Francesco Cirillo in the late 1980s. The technique uses a timer to break work into intervals, traditionally 25 minutes in length, separated by short breaks.

Features
* Timer Mechanism: It follows the Pomodoro Technique's intervals, with 25 minutes of work time followed by a short break of 5 minutes. After every 4 work sessions, a longer break of 20 minutes is provided.
* Countdown Mechanism: The countdown is displayed visually, showing minutes and seconds left for the current interval.
* Reset Functionality: Users can reset the timer at any point.
* UI Setup: The user interface is designed using Tkinter, providing a simple yet intuitive experience.

Components
* Canvas Display: A canvas is used to display a tomato image, serving as a visual representation of the timer.
* Timer Text: The countdown timer is displayed in text format on the canvas.
* Control Buttons: Buttons for starting and resetting the timer are provided for user interaction.
* Checkmark Display: After completing a work session, checkmarks are displayed to indicate completed sessions.

Instructions
* 		Clone or download the repository to your local machine.
* 		Run the Python script (pomodoro.py) using a Python interpreter.
* 		Click the "Start" button to begin the Pomodoro timer.
* 		Use the "Reset" button to reset the timer at any point.

Dependencies
* Python 3.x
* Tkinter (standard Python interface to the Tk GUI toolkit)
* tomato.png (Tomato image used in the UI)
